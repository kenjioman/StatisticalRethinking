    "## Key Ideas/ Summary\n",
    "### Models vs Statistical Tests:\n",
    "* Models are potentially powerful tools to help us better understand the world better, but with their power, comes the potential to abuse it, so beware.\n",
    " - Statistical testing is just using a set of models previously designed (with their sets of assumptions) -- instead of using/ memorizing pre-canned models, let's understand the process of building and evaluating models directly.\n",
    " - Hypotheses lead to process models lead to statistical models -- remember, the same statistical model can be explained by contradictory hypotheses/ process models.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Framework for model building/ vetting:\n",
    "* Bayesian data analysis\n",
    " - at the core, just count all the ways data can happen, according to the assumptions\n",
    " - Models with more ways that are consistent with the data are more plausible\n",
    "* Multilevel models\n",
    " - Allows one one build more complex models (models within models), to better capture the complexity of modern scientific problems.\n",
    "* Model comparisons\n",
    " - Compare different models to see which is better\n",
    " - Recognize when something has gone wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small vs large world:\n",
    "* Worry about both what set of assuptions went into the construction of the small world of the model, and how that relates/ reflects the real \"large\" world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model building strategy:\n",
    "1. Design the model (data story)\n",
    "2. Condition on the data (update)\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model (critique)\n",
    "\n",
    "1 leads to 2 leads to 3, leads to 1."

    "## Lecture Notes\n",
    "(a more complete annotation of what was covered/ said).\n",
    "### People come to statistics through a broad range of backgrounds.\n",
    "* Statistics originally developed to study agriculture where a broad range of statistical hopothesis testing methods developed\n",
    "* However, modern problems usually don't nicely fit into these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Golem of Prague -- warning that if you're not careful, models (golems) can cause a lot of problems/ are easy to misuse.\n",
    "* Models are:\n",
    " - Made of silicon\n",
    " - Animated by \"truth\" (we desire to discover something about the world through the use of our models)\n",
    " - Hopefully powerful\n",
    " - Blind to creator's intent\n",
    " - Easy to misuse\n",
    " - Not even false (model exists, no question about that, but the question is *how does it behave?*)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian philosophy -- against tests\n",
    "* \"tests\" are specialized pre-made \"procedures\"\n",
    "* Most developed in early 20th century, fragile, and eclipsed with more recent tools\n",
    " * Usually developed in randomized trials with large effects, where measurement problems are solved\n",
    "* Don't believe: **Purpose of a statistical procedure is to falsify a hypothesis**.\n",
    " - Fine to say purpose of research paradigm is to falsify hypothesis, but that is *not* the purpose of a statistical test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example from molecular evolution:\n",
    "* Statistical models are *not* hypothesis\n",
    "* 3 levels in scientific process\n",
    "\n",
    " * Hypothesis (tends to be/ start out more vague)\n",
    "  - Evolution is neutral\n",
    "  - Selection matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Process Models (a mathematical instantiation of the hypothesis)\n",
    "  - Neutral equillibrium\n",
    "  - Constant Selection\n",
    "  - Fluctuating Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistical Models (to test to process model with real data)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Same hypothesis can create several process models. Several process models can create statistical models. Same statistical model can arise from different process models, even though the underlying hypotheses are different/ competing! (See 21:12 in the video for chart/ description)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure of falsification (philosophy of Karl Popper)\n",
    "* Null models not unique\n",
    "* Should falsify *explanatory* model, not the *null* model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Golem Engineering\n",
    "* Need framework for developing and vetting statistical golems\n",
    "* Although there are lots of options/ methods, will use 3:\n",
    " * Baysian Data Analysis\n",
    " * Multilevel modelling\n",
    " * Model comparison\n",
    " \n",
    "### What is Baysian Data Analysis?\n",
    "* The **original** way of doing data analysis\n",
    "* Use probability to describe uncertanty\n",
    " * Extends ordinary logic (true/false) to continuous plausibility\n",
    "* Computationally difficult, so needed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n",
    "* Used to be controversial, but basically all stats departments are now Bayesian\n",
    " * Ronald Fisher (early 20th century): Bayesian analysis \"must be wholly rejected\".\n",
    " \n",
    "Core idea:\n",
    "* Count all the ways data can happen, according to the assumptions\n",
    "* Assumptions with more ways that are consistent with data are more plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multilevel Models\n",
    "* Models with *multiple levels* of uncertainty\n",
    " * replace parameters with models (have models in models)\n",
    "* Lots of uses (common ones):\n",
    " * Repeat/ imbalanced sampling\n",
    " * Study variation\n",
    " * Avoid averaging\n",
    " * Phylogenetics, factor and path analysis, networks, spatial models\n",
    "* Natural Bayesian strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model comparison\n",
    "* Compare multiple models\n",
    "* Instead of falsifying a null model, compare **meaningful** models.\n",
    "* Basic problem\n",
    " - Overfitting -- \"most important phenomenom in statistics\" is model learns the data too well, leads to poor statistics (scientists frequently do this too much, while industry frequently handles this better).\n",
    " - Causal inference\n",
    "* Must distinguish prediction from inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small and Large Worlds\n",
    "* Sensu L.J. Savage (1954)\n",
    " - Small world: The world of the model's assumptions.  Bayesian golems are optimal, in the small world\n",
    " - Large world: The real world.  No guarantee of optimality for any kind of model.\n",
    "* We have to worry about both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Garden of forking data\n",
    "* The future:\n",
    " - Full of branching paths\n",
    " - Each choice closes some\n",
    "* The data:\n",
    " - Many possible events\n",
    " - Each observation eliminates some\n",
    " \n",
    "Example of bag with blue/white marbels.  Show all possible paths/ possibilities with the assumed number of blue/white marbels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayesian updating -- with new information, update our expectations.\n",
    "* Bayesian inference is good in that it can more easily use all data (information of a different type)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counts to plausibility\n",
    "* Basis of applied probability\n",
    " - Things that can happen more ways are more plausible\n",
    "* Plausibility is *probability*: Set of non-negative real numbers that sum to one\n",
    " - Probability theory is just a set of shortcuts for counting\n",
