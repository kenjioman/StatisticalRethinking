# Homework
This contains my efforts at completing the homework from  Richard McElreath's
[Winter 2019 Statistical Rethinking course](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019).

To note, the `weekXX.pdf` and `weekxx_solutions.pdf` files are from his
repository, and are copied here simply to ease in referencing them.
I claim no ownership of their contents. This directory contains the homework
assignments, while Submissions contains my solution attempts, and
Solutions contains the solutions given from the course.
