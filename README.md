# Statistical Rethinking Winter 2019
By: Kenji Oman

This contains my efforts to follow along Richard McElreath's [Winter 2019
Statistical Rethinking course](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019), albeit, somewhat
more slowly than the course progresses itself.  Also, I will try to implement
everything in python using the [pymc3 module](https://docs.pymc.io/).
Although I recognize that the creators of pymc3 have already [ported the code
from the book to pymc3/ python
](https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking),
I will only use these as a reference when necessary and will largely try to
create my solutions using only the online documentation as an exercise to
better understand the pymc3 api.

## Contents
* [Homework](./Homework) contains my solutions to homework problems as assigned
as a part of the class.  I may also have some work trying out some of the
problems from the book.
* [Notes](./Notes) contains my efforts to re-create figures/ methods from the
book or lectures, perhaps extending them some more.
* [Data](./Data) contains the data files used to follow along with the course.

## Other Files
* environment.yml -- contains information about my conda environment, created
from: `conda list --explicit > environment.yml`
